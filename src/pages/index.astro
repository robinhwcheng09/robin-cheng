		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="lead">
		I work with operational workflows and data systems. Most projects involve 
		automating manual processes, building pipelines, and creating tools that 
		help teams move faster.
		</p>
		<p>
		My approach is straightforward: map existing processes, identify what's broken, 
		build systems that fix it. Usually this means writing code to automate repetitive 
		tasks and creating dashboards for operational visibility.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm particularly interested in workflow optimization and data pipeline architecture. 
		Currently based in Tokyo, working with teams across different time zones.
