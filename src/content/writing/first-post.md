This is my first blog post using the new system. It's written in Markdown, which makes it easy to write and format.

## How this works

I just create a Markdown file in `src/content/writing/` and it automatically appears on my writing page. No arrays to update, no manual linking.

## What I can use

All the normal Markdown features work:

- Bullet lists like this
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://astro.build)

### Subheadings too

Just write naturally. The styling is all handled automatically.

## Next steps

I can write as many posts as I want. Each one is just a new Markdown file.
